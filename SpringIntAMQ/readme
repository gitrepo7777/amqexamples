Little details of code:

The main flow of the application is contained in context.xml, which is loaded by ClassPathApplicationContext.

GatewayProxyFactoryBean does all the work of creating the proxy of SampleGateway and invoking the method serve() on the proxy and sending argument to JMSOutboundGateway.

The OutBoundGateway then delivers it to ActiveMQ.

On the other end, JMSInboundGateway waits for the requestQueue, and traps this request to transfer the SOAP XML message to SI transformers and routers to convert it to POJO request.

The request is handled by Service.add(Data) and the response is put back on the inboundGateway which delivers it back to ActiveMQ.

The ActiveMQ transfers the response back to client JMSOutboundGateway which transfers it back to SampleGateway as a return value.
